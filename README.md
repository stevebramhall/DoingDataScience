# DoingDataScience
Originator: Steve Bramhall, Masters of Data Science student & yes I love data due to the power it can provide

School: Southern Methodist Univerity (SMU)

The course: MSDS6301, Section 404

Professor: Bivin Sadler

PURPOSE:
The repository will hold work for SMU's Doing Data Science Mater's Program Course. It is a great way to practice developing reproducible work. Please feel free to provide any feedback that will benefit me and advance my knowledge.

TOPICS:
I expect most work to be related to R code including RMarkdown. There may be some SAS code included, too. Some data sets may be borrowed from other repositories or sources but they should be noted when doing so. Most work will be my original work unless noted otherwise. Some code snipets may be borrowed (and noted as such).
